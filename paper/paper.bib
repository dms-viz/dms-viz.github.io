  abstract = {Knowledge of the fitness effects of mutations to SARS-CoV-2 can inform assessment of new variants, design of therapeutics resistant to escape, and understanding of the functions of viral proteins. However, experimentally measuring effects of mutations is challenging: we lack tractable lab assays for many SARS-CoV-2 proteins, and comprehensive deep mutational scanning has been applied to only two SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Here, we develop an approach that leverages millions of publicly available SARS-CoV-2 sequences to estimate effects of mutations. We first calculate how many independent occurrences of each mutation are expected to be observed along the SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny in the absence of selection. We then compare these expected observations to the actual observations to estimate the effect of each mutation. These estimates correlate well with deep mutational scanning measurements. For most genes, synonymous mutations are nearly neutral, stop-codon mutations are deleterious, and amino acid mutations have a range of effects. However, some viral accessory proteins are under little to no selection. We provide interactive visualizations of effects of mutations to all SARS-CoV-2 proteins (https://jbloomlab.github.io/SARS2-mut-fitness/). The framework we describe is applicable to any virus for which the number of available sequences is sufficiently large that many independent occurrences of each neutral mutation are observed.},

We use these libraries to map escape mutations from neutralizing antibodies targeting the receptor-binding domain, N-terminal domain, and S2 subunit of spike. Overall, this work establishes a high-throughput and safe approach to measure how {$\sim$}105 combinations of mutations affect antibody neutralization and spike-mediated infection. Notably, the platform described here can be extended to the entry proteins of many other viruses.},

  abstract = {Sequencing has revealed hundreds of millions of human genetic variants, and continued efforts will only add to this variant avalanche. Insufficient information exists to interpret the effects of most variants, limiting opportunities for precision medicine and comprehension of genome function. A solution lies in experimental assessment of the functional effect of variants, which can reveal their biological and clinical impact. However, variant effect assays have generally been undertaken reactively for individual variants only after and, in most cases long after, their first observation. Now, multiplexed assays of variant effect can characterise massive numbers of variants simultaneously, yielding variant effect maps that reveal the function of every possible single nucleotide change in a gene or regulatory element. Generating maps for every protein encoding gene and regulatory element in the human genome would create an 'Atlas' of variant effect maps and transform our understanding of genetics and usher in a new era of nucleotide-resolution functional knowledge of the genome. An Atlas would reveal the fundamental biology of the human genome, inform human evolution, empower the development and use of therapeutics and maximize the utility of genomics for diagnosing and treating disease. The Atlas of Variant Effects Alliance is an international collaborative group comprising hundreds of researchers, technologists and clinicians dedicated to realising an Atlas of Variant Effects to help deliver on the promise of genomics.},

  abstract = {The influenza virus polymerase is central to influenza virus evolution. Adaptive mutations within the polymerase are often a prerequisite for efficient spread of novel animal-derived viruses in human populations. The polymerase also determines fidelity, and therefore the rate at which the virus will acquire mutations that lead to host range expansion, drug resistance, or antigenic drift. Despite its importance to viral replication and evolution, our understanding of the mutational effects and associated constraints on the influenza RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is relatively limited. We performed deep mutational scanning of the A/WSN/1933(H1N1) PB1, generating a library of 95.4\% of amino acid substitutions at 757 sites. After accuracy filters, we were able to measure replicative fitness for 13,354 (84\%) of all possible amino acid substitutions, and 16 were validated by results from pairwise competition assays. Functional and structural constraints were better revealed by individual sites involved in RNA or protein interactions than by major subdomains defined by sequence conservation. Mutational tolerance, as defined by site entropy, was correlated with evolutionary potential, as captured by diversity in available H1N1 sequences. Of 29 beneficial sites, many have either been identified in the natural evolution of PB1 or shown experimentally to have important impacts on replication and adaptation. Accessibility of amino acid substitutions by single nucleotide mutation was a key factor in determining whether mutations appeared in natural PB1 evolution. Our work provides a comprehensive map of mutational effects on a viral RdRp and a valuable resource for subsequent studies of influenza replication and evolution.},

We apply VAMP-seq to quantify the abundance of 7,801 single-amino-acid variants of PTEN and TPMT, proteins in which functional variants are clinically actionable. We identify 1,138 PTEN and 777 TPMT variants that result in low protein abundance, and may be pathogenic or alter drug metabolism, respectively. We observe selection for low-abundance PTEN variants in cancer, and show that p.Pro38Ser, which accounts for {\textasciitilde}10\% of PTEN missense variants in melanoma, functions via a dominant-negative mechanism. Finally, we demonstrate that VAMP-seq is applicable to other genes, highlighting its generalizability.},
